Personal Project: "AI Psychologist" Web Page – because sometimes, all you need to hear is: "That’s complicated..."

As a tech enthusiast with a passion for creative ideas, I developed a humorous web page that simulates an AI psychologist. The concept? A virtual “therapist” that replies to any message with the classic phrase: "That’s complicated."

The idea started as a joke among friends but turned into a fun little project to practice front-end skills and basic JavaScript logic. Beyond the humor, it lightly explores the often limited usefulness of automated responses in human interactions.

Tools used:

HTML/CSS for structure and styling

JavaScript for dynamic interaction

A touch of creativity and sarcasm 😄

It's a simple project, but it shows how code, creativity, and a bit of humor can come together in a functional and entertaining way.
